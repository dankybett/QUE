# When It Becomes Distressing

Sometimes perceptual experiences themselves aren't harmful — but how we interpret them, or the situations we're in, can make them feel much worse.

## What Makes These Experiences Distressing?

- **Appraisal**: What goes through your mind when the experience happens?  
- **Content**: Sometimes what we see or hear is distressing in itself.  
- **Not being understood**: Feeling like no one else "gets it" can make things harder.  
- **Other stress**: Life stressors (school, work, relationships) can amplify these experiences.

<Accordion title="Reflection">
- What thoughts run through your mind when you have these experiences?  
- What part of the content makes them distressing?  
- What do you wish others understood about what you're going through?  
- What else is happening in your life that could be contributing?

## Visual Metaphors

Our brain sometimes represents stress visually when emotions feel overwhelming or unclear.  

Examples:  
- **Anxiety about others' opinions** → a shadowy figure in the corner of your eye.  
- **Overwhelm from exams, work, or home pressures** → a monster appearing when alone at night.

## The Hot Cross Bun Model

Thoughts, feelings, behaviours, and bodily sensations all interact.  
When faced with distress:  
- Thoughts feed the distress  
- Feelings and bodily sensations intensify (fight/flight/freeze)  
- Behaviours can keep the cycle going

This can lead to a repeating cycle of distress.

- What **feelings** did you notice?

- How did you **behave**?

## Body Map

Our brain and body prepare us to respond to perceived danger.  
Distress may show up as:  
- Stomach ache, headache, dizziness  
- Shaking, tense muscles, crying  
- Fast heartbeat, shallow breathing  
- Shutdown, dry mouth
