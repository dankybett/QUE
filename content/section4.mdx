# What Can Help

It can be distressing to feel unsettling sensations. When the brain is in "fight, flight, or freeze" mode, it struggles to think clearly.  

Learning ways to calm and soothe yourself can help bring your body back into balance, so you feel more in control.

## How to Ease These Sensations

Here are some strategies that help regulate your body and mind:  

- Breathe deeply and slowly  
- Remind yourself: *this is an automatic, protective response*  
- Count or spell backwards  
- Massage or rub your feet, hands, head, ears, neck, or thighs  
- Hold your chest or belly while breathing  
- Use your voice: sing, hum, gargle, or chant  
- Connect with someone supportive  
- Splash your face with cold water, sip water, or hold ice cubes  
- Shake it out: move your hands, jump on the spot, tap your feet  
- Recall a peaceful, happy, or funny memory  
- Smell something pleasant  
- Notice the ground beneath your feet and the support of your chair/bed  
- Touch something warm, soft, cold, or textured  
- Focus on what's around you in the present moment

## Create Your Own Protocol

When first learning these strategies, it helps to have a step-by-step **Unsettling Experience Protocol**.  

Example steps:  
1. Notice sensations in your body (e.g., heart racing, sweating).  
2. Name the emotion: "I am afraid."  
3. Remind yourself: *This is my body's response to an unsettling experience.*  
4. Ground yourself by naming three things you can see, hear, or smell.  
5. Say today's date and check if you're safe.  
6. If safe, affirm: *I'm having an unsettling perceptual experience — and I'm not in danger.*  
7. If unsafe, take steps to protect yourself.

## Controllability

Some distress comes from feeling powerless. You can experiment with building control:  

- Start with a perception that feels less threatening.  
- Try to bring it to mind in a safe, calm space.  
- Practice stopping it after a few seconds.  
- Repeat until your distress level is low (≤3/10).  
- Gradually move on to more challenging perceptions.
