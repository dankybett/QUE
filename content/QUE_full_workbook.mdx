# Understanding Unsettling Experiences

Many people experience strange, confusing, or unsettling visual or sensory experiences. These are more common than you might think, and they don’t always mean something is “wrong” or that you are unwell.

This section helps you explore what perceptual experiences are, how they differ from hallucinations, and why it can sometimes feel difficult to tell them apart.

---

## Perceptual Experiences or Hallucinations?

A **hallucination** involves our senses being activated in the absence of something happening in the outside world. This can happen to anyone — sometimes it feels distressing, other times it doesn’t.

**Think about it:**  
Have you ever experienced hearing something that wasn’t really there?  
- Your name being called?  
- A child crying?  
- Your phone vibrating?  

These could be:  
- **Misperceptions**  
- **Illusions**  
- **Hallucinations**  
- Or vivid thoughts that grab your attention  

<Callout type="normalise">
It could be any of these things! Experiencing them doesn’t automatically mean you are unwell.
</Callout>

## Inside vs Outside the Mind

Sometimes it’s hard to say whether an experience is “inside” or “outside” the mind.  

- You may hear a voice or see a face, but know: *“it’s just in my mind.”*  
- Others may vividly imagine something so strongly that it feels real (e.g., people with a photographic memory).  

<Accordion title="Reflection">
Think about a time you had a strong perceptual experience.  
- Did you know in the moment that it was in your mind?  
- Did it feel 100% real?  
- Were you unsure?  
</Accordion>

## Examples of Perceived Visual Experiences

Even without mental illness, unusual visuals can happen in everyday life:

- **Arctic explorers**: vivid visuals when deprived of sensory input.  
- **Prisoner’s cinema**: light shows or patterns when kept in darkness.  
- **Phantom limb**: sensations from a missing limb (pain, itchiness).  
- **Rubber hand illusion**: the brain feels sensations from a fake limb.

## Visual Imagery

We all imagine differently in our “mind’s eye.” Some people can picture things vividly (**hyperphantasia**), while others struggle to see images at all (**aphantasia**).

Try the **Red Apple Test**:  
Close your eyes and imagine an apple. Can you clearly see its colour, shape, and stem?  
- 1 = most vivid, almost like real vision  
- 5 = little to no image  

<Accordion title="Reflection">
Where would you place yourself on this spectrum?  
</Accordion>



# Why Does This Happen?

Perceptual experiences are created by the brain and body working together. Sometimes they can be vivid or unusual, especially in certain states or conditions.

---

## Hypnagogic and Hypnopompic Experiences

Have you ever seen or heard something while falling asleep or just waking up?  
These are called **hypnagogic (falling asleep)** or **hypnopompic (waking up)** hallucinations.  

They are quite common — around 37% of people experience them at some point.  
- They may be visual, auditory, tactile, or even involve movement sensations.  
- People often feel “fully awake” even though the brain is still partly in sleep mode (measured by EEG).  

<Accordion title="Reflection">
Have you experienced this?  
- What did you see or hear?  
- How long did it last?  
- How did it make you feel?  
</Accordion>

---

## How the Brain Creates Perceptual Experiences

Our brains process information in two ways:  

- **Bottom-up processing**: responding to raw sensory input.  
- **Top-down processing**: guided by our expectations and past experiences.  

When sensory input is unclear (e.g., in the dark), the brain leans more on top-down processing — filling in the gaps.

<Callout type="info">
The brain is a “prediction machine” — it constantly guesses what it expects to see, hear, and feel.
</Callout>

<Accordion title="Try this">
Have you ever…  
- Walked onto an escalator that wasn’t moving?  
- Picked up a bottle you thought was full but was empty?  

These are everyday examples of the brain predicting incorrectly.  
</Accordion>

---

## Illusions and Misperceptions

Illusions show how the brain can “misread” reality:  
- Optical illusions (moving colours that are actually still).  
- Viral debates (the blue/black vs. white/gold dress).  
- **McGurk Effect** — what we see changes what we hear.  
- **Phantom words** — overlapping sounds create the sense of hearing speech.

## Pareidolia

Have you ever seen faces in clouds, or a dog in random black-and-white splodges?  
This is called **pareidolia** — when the brain finds patterns or meaning in ambiguous images.

<Accordion title="Try this">
Look at the Dalmatian illusion or clouds in the sky. What do you see?  
</Accordion>

---

## Intrusive Thoughts or Images

It is common for unwanted thoughts, images, or urges to appear involuntarily.  
- They can feel disturbing or link to past trauma.  
- Most people experience them at some point.  

<Callout type="normalise">
Having an intrusive thought does not make you a bad person.  
</Callout>

<Accordion title="Reflection">
Think of a time you had a disturbing thought or image:  
- What was it?  
- How much control did you feel you had?  
- What gentle phrase could you remind yourself of next time?  
</Accordion>

---

## Daydreaming

Daydreaming = imagining scenarios, possibilities, or memories.  
- Sometimes it’s light and casual.  
- Other times, it’s **immersive** and feels vivid.  

**Maladaptive Daydreaming** happens when daydreaming becomes so intense it interferes with daily life.  

<Accordion title="Try this">
Describe or draw one of your recent daydreams. How real did it feel?  
</Accordion>



# When It Becomes Distressing

Sometimes perceptual experiences themselves aren’t harmful — but how we interpret them, or the situations we’re in, can make them feel much worse.

---

## What Makes These Experiences Distressing?

- **Appraisal**: What goes through your mind when the experience happens?  
- **Content**: Sometimes what we see or hear is distressing in itself.  
- **Not being understood**: Feeling like no one else “gets it” can make things harder.  
- **Other stress**: Life stressors (school, work, relationships) can amplify these experiences.

<Accordion title="Reflection">
- What thoughts run through your mind when you have these experiences?  
- What part of the content makes them distressing?  
- What do you wish others understood about what you’re going through?  
- What else is happening in your life that could be contributing?  
</Accordion>

---

## Visual Metaphors

Our brain sometimes represents stress visually when emotions feel overwhelming or unclear.  

Examples:  
- **Anxiety about others’ opinions** → a shadowy figure in the corner of your eye.  
- **Overwhelm from exams, work, or home pressures** → a monster appearing when alone at night.  

<Accordion title="Reflection">
What current stressors do you have in your life?  
When do you usually notice unsettling perceptions?  
</Accordion>

---

## The Hot Cross Bun Model

Thoughts, feelings, behaviours, and bodily sensations all interact.  
When faced with distress:  
- Thoughts feed the distress  
- Feelings and bodily sensations intensify (fight/flight/freeze)  
- Behaviours can keep the cycle going  

<Callout type="info">
This can lead to a repeating cycle of distress.
</Callout>

<Accordion title="Exercise">
Think of a recent unsettling perceptual experience.  
- What was the **situation**?  
- What **thoughts** went through your mind?  
- What **feelings** did you notice?  
- What **bodily sensations** did you feel?  
- How did you **behave**?  
</Accordion>

---

## Body Map

Our brain and body prepare us to respond to perceived danger.  
Distress may show up as:  
- Stomach ache, headache, dizziness  
- Shaking, tense muscles, crying  
- Fast heartbeat, shallow breathing  
- Shutdown, dry mouth  

<Accordion title="Exercise">
On a body map (or imagine your body), where do you feel distress most strongly?  
</Accordion>



# What Can Help

It can be distressing to feel unsettling sensations. When the brain is in “fight, flight, or freeze” mode, it struggles to think clearly.  

Learning ways to calm and soothe yourself can help bring your body back into balance, so you feel more in control.  

---

## How to Ease These Sensations

Here are some strategies that help regulate your body and mind:  

- Breathe deeply and slowly  
- Remind yourself: *this is an automatic, protective response*  
- Count or spell backwards  
- Massage or rub your feet, hands, head, ears, neck, or thighs  
- Hold your chest or belly while breathing  
- Use your voice: sing, hum, gargle, or chant  
- Connect with someone supportive  
- Splash your face with cold water, sip water, or hold ice cubes  
- Shake it out: move your hands, jump on the spot, tap your feet  
- Recall a peaceful, happy, or funny memory  
- Smell something pleasant  
- Notice the ground beneath your feet and the support of your chair/bed  
- Touch something warm, soft, cold, or textured  
- Focus on what’s around you in the present moment

## Create Your Own Protocol

When first learning these strategies, it helps to have a step-by-step **Unsettling Experience Protocol**.  

Example steps:  
1. Notice sensations in your body (e.g., heart racing, sweating).  
2. Name the emotion: “I am afraid.”  
3. Remind yourself: *This is my body’s response to an unsettling experience.*  
4. Ground yourself by naming three things you can see, hear, or smell.  
5. Say today’s date and check if you’re safe.  
6. If safe, affirm: *I’m having an unsettling perceptual experience — and I’m not in danger.*  
7. If unsafe, take steps to protect yourself.  

<Accordion title="Reflection">
What steps would you include in your own protocol? Write them down or save them on your phone.

## Controllability

Some distress comes from feeling powerless. You can experiment with building control:  

- Start with a perception that feels less threatening.  
- Try to bring it to mind in a safe, calm space.  
- Practice stopping it after a few seconds.  
- Repeat until your distress level is low (≤3/10).  
- Gradually move on to more challenging perceptions.  

<Accordion title="Exercise">
Track your **Distress (0–10)** and **Controllability** over time as you practice.
