# Why Does This Happen?

Perceptual experiences are created by the brain and body working together. Sometimes they can be vivid or unusual, especially in certain states or conditions.

## Hypnagogic and Hypnopompic Experiences

Have you ever seen or heard something while falling asleep or just waking up?  
These are called **hypnagogic (falling asleep)** or **hypnopompic (waking up)** hallucinations.  

They are quite common — around 37% of people experience them at some point.  
- They may be visual, auditory, tactile, or even involve movement sensations.  
- People often feel "fully awake" even though the brain is still partly in sleep mode (measured by EEG).

- What did you see or hear?

## How the Brain Creates Perceptual Experiences

Our brains process information in two ways:  

- **Bottom-up processing**: responding to raw sensory input.  
- **Top-down processing**: guided by our expectations and past experiences.  

When sensory input is unclear (e.g., in the dark), the brain leans more on top-down processing — filling in the gaps.

<Callout type="info">
The brain is a "prediction machine" — it constantly guesses what it expects to see, hear, and feel.

Have you ever…  
- Walked onto an escalator that wasn't moving?  
- Picked up a bottle you thought was full but was empty?  

These are everyday examples of the brain predicting incorrectly.

## Illusions and Misperceptions

Illusions show how the brain can "misread" reality:  
- Optical illusions (moving colours that are actually still).  
- Viral debates (the blue/black vs. white/gold dress).  
- **McGurk Effect** — what we see changes what we hear.  
- **Phantom words** — overlapping sounds create the sense of hearing speech.

## Pareidolia

Have you ever seen faces in clouds, or a dog in random black-and-white splodges?  
This is called **pareidolia** — when the brain finds patterns or meaning in ambiguous images.

## Intrusive Thoughts or Images

It is common for unwanted thoughts, images, or urges to appear involuntarily.  
- They can feel disturbing or link to past trauma.  
- Most people experience them at some point.  

<Callout type="normalise">
Having an intrusive thought does not make you a bad person.

<Accordion title="Reflection">
Think of a time you had a disturbing thought or image:  
- What was it?  
- How much control did you feel you had?  
- What gentle phrase could you remind yourself of next time?

## Daydreaming

Daydreaming = imagining scenarios, possibilities, or memories.  
- Sometimes it's light and casual.  
- Other times, it's **immersive** and feels vivid.  

**Maladaptive Daydreaming** happens when daydreaming becomes so intense it interferes with daily life.
