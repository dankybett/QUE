# Understanding Unsettling Experiences

Many people experience strange, confusing, or unsettling visual or sensory experiences. These are more common than you might think, and they don't always mean something is "wrong" or that you are unwell.

This section helps you explore what perceptual experiences are, how they differ from hallucinations, and why it can sometimes feel difficult to tell them apart.

## Perceptual Experiences or Hallucinations: What's the Difference and Does it Matter?

Have you ever experienced hearing:

![Have you ever experienced hearing something that wasn't really there?](/images/haveyoueverexperienced.png)

When in fact, it wasn't actually happening?

This is something **most** people experience one time or another. So what is happening? Are these experiences hallucinations? misperceptions? illusions? or vivid attention grabbing thoughts?

It could be any of these things!

## What is a Hallucination?

A **hallucination** involves our senses being activated in the absence of something obviously happening in the outside world. But this sort of thing happens all the time. Sometimes in ways which are distressing, sometimes not. 

So when does it become an issue? Let's discuss.

## Inside vs Outside the Mind

Sometimes it's hard to say whether an experience is "inside" or "outside" the mind.   

- You may hear a voice or see a face, but know: *"it's just in my mind."*  
- Others may vividly imagine something so strongly that it feels real (e.g., people with a photographic memory).  

Often, it's difficult to draw a line between hallucinations, illusions, misperceptions, and vivid perceptual experiences which come from our our thoughts and imagination. 


**Continuum**

Some say it's more like a continuum: 

![Continuum of imagined perceptual experiences to hallucinations](/images/hallucinationcontinuum.png)

And we might move back and forth along this continuum depending on the situation. 


<Accordion title="Reflection">
Think about a time you had a strong perceptual experience.  
- Did you know in the moment that it was in your mind?  
- Did it feel 100% real?  
- Were you unsure?

## Under certain conditions, any one of us can hallucinate

In the 1930s, research by psychologist Wolfgang Metzger established that when subjects gazed into a featureless field of vision they consistently hallucinated.

This helped us understand why Antarctic explorers seeing nothing but white snow for a long time reported hallucinations and an altered state of mind.
Sir Ernest Shackleton, in his 1919 book South, described his belief that an incorporeal companion joined him and his men during the final leg of his 1914–1917 Antarctic expedition, which became stranded in pack ice for more than two years and endured immense hardships in the attempt to reach safety. Shackleton wrote, "during that long and racking march of thirty-six hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers of South Georgia, it seemed to me often that we were four, not three."
 
 This is sometimes referred to as the 'third man factor' and inspired poet T.S. Eliot to write about it in the Poem 'The Waste Land':
 
 <Callout type="normalise">
Who is the third who walks always beside you?
When I count, there are only you and I together
But when I look ahead up the white road
There is always another one walking beside you
Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded
I do not know whether a man or a woman
— But who is that on the other side of you?

T. S. Eliot, The Waste Land

This phenemon has also been referred to as the **'Prisoner's cinema'.** Inmates placed in solitary confinement, deprived of visual simulation sometimes report a “lightshow” of different colours that appear out of darkness. These lights can take the form of shapes, faces, figures etc.

  Truck drivers, pilots, and astronauts have also reported similar experiences

**Phantom Limb Syndrome** 

Individuals that have had one (or more) of their limbs removed sometimes report still experiencing sensations from that missing limb - pain, itchiness, discomfort, aching etc. There are some experiments that you can watch online where people experience feeling sensations from a fake/prop limb  


  
**Rubber hand illusion**

The brain feels sensations from a fake limb.

## Visual Imagery


Visual imagery refers to how we perceive things in our ‘mind’s eye’. For some, this is a simple task that conjure detail images. For others, it is a difficult task. This is understood to be on a spectrum: 



 ![a spectrum from aphantasia to hyperphantasia](/images/visualimageryspectrum.png)
 


 A quick at-home test for finding out your visual imagery ability is called the **red apple test.** 
 
 How well can you see the apple visually on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the most vivid? Can you see its colour, shape and the length of the stem?

Where would you place yourself on this spectrum?
