# Understanding Unsettling Experiences

Many people experience strange, confusing, or unsettling visual or sensory experiences. These are more common than you might think, and they don't always mean something is "wrong" or that you are unwell.

This section helps you explore what perceptual experiences are, how they differ from hallucinations, and why it can sometimes feel difficult to tell them apart.

## Perceptual Experiences or Hallucinations?

A **hallucination** involves our senses being activated in the absence of something happening in the outside world. This can happen to anyone â€” sometimes it feels distressing, other times it doesn't.

**Think about it:**  
Have you ever experienced hearing something that wasn't really there?  
- Your name being called?  
- A child crying?  
- Your phone vibrating?  

These could be:  
- **Misperceptions**  
- **Illusions**  
- **Hallucinations**  
- Or vivid thoughts that grab your attention

It could be any of these things! Experiencing them doesn't automatically mean you are unwell.

## Inside vs Outside the Mind

Sometimes it's hard to say whether an experience is "inside" or "outside" the mind.  

- You may hear a voice or see a face, but know: *"it's just in my mind."*  
- Others may vividly imagine something so strongly that it feels real (e.g., people with a photographic memory).  

<Accordion title="Reflection">
Think about a time you had a strong perceptual experience.  
- Did you know in the moment that it was in your mind?  
- Did it feel 100% real?  
- Were you unsure?

## Examples of Perceived Visual Experiences

Even without mental illness, unusual visuals can happen in everyday life:

- **Arctic explorers**: vivid visuals when deprived of sensory input.  
- **Prisoner's cinema**: light shows or patterns when kept in darkness.  
- **Phantom limb**: sensations from a missing limb (pain, itchiness).  
- **Rubber hand illusion**: the brain feels sensations from a fake limb.

## Visual Imagery

We all imagine differently in our "mind's eye." Some people can picture things vividly (**hyperphantasia**), while others struggle to see images at all (**aphantasia**).

Try the **Red Apple Test**:  
Close your eyes and imagine an apple. Can you clearly see its colour, shape, and stem?  
- 1 = most vivid, almost like real vision  
- 5 = little to no image
